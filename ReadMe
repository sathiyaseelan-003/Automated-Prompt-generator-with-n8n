# 🔄 n8n Dynamic Prompt Generator

This is my first automation project using [n8n](https://n8n.io), built to guide users in creating detailed and accurate prompts for AI tools by asking dynamic, step-by-step questions.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Accepts a user input like “I want to build X”
- Dynamically asks follow-up questions:
  - What tools do you want to use?
  - What kind of input/output do you expect?
  - For image prompts: What style, object, or use-case?
- Generates a final custom AI prompt

## 📁 Files

- `dynamic_prompt_generator.json`: The complete exported n8n workflow

## 📌 How to Use

1. Import the JSON into your n8n instance.
2. Run the workflow.
3. Interact with the prompt form and get a refined AI-ready prompt!

## 🚀 Built With

- n8n (open-source automation)
